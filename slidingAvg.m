function out = slidingAvg(x,win,step,dim)
    % takes a vector or 2D matrix and averages across it with window size win and steps of
    % step. Win should be odd, if it is even, then the window will be set to one
    % less than win. Default dimension (dim) to slide across is 1.
    % Default step is win, in order to not overlap windows.
